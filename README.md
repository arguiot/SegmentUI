# SegmentUI
SegmentUI is an innovative way of building declarative UIs and processing values over time from JavaScript. It uses a declarative syntax so you can simply state what your user interface should do. The framework  also provides a declarative Es7 API for processing values over time. These values can represent many kinds of asynchronous events.

SegmentUI wasn't built to interact with the DOM in a fancy but to act as a layer between what the user sees and your code. In this way, it's build around two main concepts: Web Components and States. 

It has a toolchain that takes care of your files and bundles everything into a single JS file. So you can focus on building great components while making great web apps.
